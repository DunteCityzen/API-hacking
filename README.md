# API HACKING
This repository was inspired by Cory Ball's book and course on Hacking APIs.

## About Repo
This repo will contain any help, any contribution or any insight I get from embarking on this journey of improving my API hacking skills.
first things first, After going through the process of setting up the lab a couple of times, I've realized that it can become a bit repetitive. That being so, I crafted a simple bash script to get you started quickly,installing all the necessary dependencies, tools and setting up the labs.

Mind you that the script is just a simple bash script meaning insufficient error handling and some prerequisites have to be taken into consideration before running it. They are:
* Make sure your system is upto date by running - sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
* Make sure you are on your home directory when running the script.
* The script creates an Opt folder in the your home directory and it will help if you don't have one there.

Feel free to build upon this script and hAPI hacking!!
